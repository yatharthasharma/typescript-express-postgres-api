# Example TypeScript / Express API

This API is using the following tech stack which can be used as a boilerplate setup when developing Express/Node based strongly-typed APIs (both REST and WebSocket examples) -

ELK Stack for logging/monitoring\
Postgres for Database storage\
TypeScript/Express framework for the API logic and Jest library for unit testing
Apache Kafka examples for both pub/sub cases, using websocket connection to subscribe to a Kafka topic.

This repository is being updated regularly so sometimes the code might not be formally written and might have comments and minor cosmetic issues.
